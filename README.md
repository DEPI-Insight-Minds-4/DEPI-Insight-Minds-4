## 1. Project Planning & Management

### Project Proposal

*Title:* AI-Powered Job Market Insights
*Overview:* This project analyzes the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the labor market using a simulated dataset of more than 500 job listings. It highlights automation risks, future growth trends, and emerging skill demands across industries.
*Objectives:*

* Explore employment trends influenced by AI.
* Identify vulnerable job categories at risk of automation.
* Highlight emerging skills needed in the workforce.
* Provide insights for policymakers, companies, and professionals.
  *Scope:* Workforce analytics, automation risk assessment, and industry trend forecasting.

### Project Plan

The project is divided into the following phases:

* *Planning Stage* – Project design and scope definition.
* *Data Preprocessing* – Data cleaning, refinement, and preparation.
* *Modeling* – Analytical models for automation risk and projections.
* *Visualization & Dashboards* – Power BI, Tableau, and Python-based charts.
* *SQL Integration* – Structuring datasets into relational queries.
* *Finalization* – Integrating outputs and preparing deliverables.


### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

* *Data Quality Issues* → Apply rigorous preprocessing.
* *Bias in Dataset* → Ensure balanced simulation.
* *Time Constraints* → Assign overlapping tasks and track progress.

### KPIs

* Accuracy of projections.
* Clarity and interactivity of dashboards.
* Timely delivery of milestones.
* Quality of documentation and reporting.

## 2. Requirements Gathering

* *Stakeholders:* Job seekers, employers, policymakers, educators.

* *User Stories:*

  * As a policymaker, I want to know which jobs are at high risk of automation.
  * As a student, I want to know which skills are in high demand.
  * As an employer, I want to anticipate future workforce needs.

* *Functional Requirements:*

  * Provide automation risk analysis.
  * Forecast job growth by sector.
  * Highlight emerging skills.

* *Non-functional Requirements:*

  * Visualizations must be interactive and accessible.
  * Dataset must be reproducible and clean.

## 3. System Analysis & Design

* *Problem Statement:* AI is transforming the labor market, but decision-makers lack clear insights into its impact.

* *Objectives:* Deliver data-driven insights to support adaptation strategies.

* *System Architecture:* Python and BI tools for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.

* *Data Modeling:* Job dataset attributes include industry, skills, automation risk, and growth projection.

---

## 4. Database Design & Data Modeling

* *SQL Integration:* Dataset will be structured into relational tables with queries for filtering industries, skills, and automation levels.

---

## 5. Implementation

* *Technology Stack:* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Power BI, Tableau, SQL.
* *Version Control:* GitHub repository for source code and documentation.
* *Collaboration:* Assigned modules by members with regular progress tracking.

---

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

* *Test Cases:* Validate preprocessing workflows, confirm modeling outputs, and test dashboard interactivity.
* *Bug Reports:* Logged during dashboard development and modeling iterations.
* *Progress Tracking:* Each task monitored by start/end dates and % completion.

---

## 7. Final Presentation & Reports

* *Deliverables:*

  * Interactive dashboards (Power BI & Tableau).
  * Python-based analysis scripts.
  * Project documentation (this report + README).
  * Final presentation (PPT/PDF).
